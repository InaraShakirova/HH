<p>
My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;<br>
Coral is far more red than her lips' red;<br>
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;<br>
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.<br>
I have seen roses damasked, red and white,<br>
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;<br>
And in some perfumes is there more delight<br>
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.<br>
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know<br>
That music hath a far more pleasing sound;<br>
I grant I never saw a goddess go;<br>
My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground.<br>
And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare<br>
As any she belied with false compare.
